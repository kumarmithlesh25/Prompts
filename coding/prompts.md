## Project Exploration
Explore a codebase to understand its structure and architecture.

```
Explore this codebase to understand its structure and architecture. I need to create a CLAUDE.md file. Please find:
1. What type of project this is (language, framework, build system)
2. How to build, test, and run the project
3. The high-level architecture and code organization
4. Any existing documentation (README.md, .cursor/rules/, .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md)
5. Key patterns or conventions used in the codebase

Be thorough - look at project configuration files, source code structure, and any existing documentation.
